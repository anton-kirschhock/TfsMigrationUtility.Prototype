# TfsMigrationUtility Prototype project
Starting from this small project, I will try to make a clean and usefull TFS migration utility to migrate projects from A to B with their history in sequence.

When the prototype is working, I will start building following compontents, based of the prototype (in order):
- TfsMigrationUtility.Core: the core Migration logic
- TfsMigrationUtility.WPF: a WPF View
- TfsMigrationUtility.CLI: a console application to assist migrations
