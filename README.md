# TfsMigrationUtility Prototype project
Starting from this small project, I will try to make a clean and usefull TFS migration utility to migrate projects from A to B.
When the prototype is working, I will start building following compontents, based of the prototype (in order):
- TfsMigrationUtility.Core: the core Migration logic
- TfsMigrationUtility.WPF: a WPF View
- TfsMigrationUtility.CLI: a console application to assist migrations

#Contributing

##First commit
The first commit of this repository will happen soon!
This commit is the complete prototype, as I am working on a private Sourcecontrol while development.
